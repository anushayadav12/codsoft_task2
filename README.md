SMS Spam Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict whether a given SMS message is spam or not using machine learning techniques. With the proliferation of spam messages, particularly in text messaging, accurate identification of spam is crucial for enhancing user experience and security.

Approach
We utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model for SMS spam detection. The steps involved in the project include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the text data, tokenization, removing stopwords, and converting text into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.
Feature Engineering: Extracting features such as word frequencies, n-grams, or TF-IDF scores to capture important information from the text data.
Model Selection: Trying out different machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Random Forest, and selecting the best-performing model.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the selected model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate test set.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the model parameters to optimize performance further.
Deployment: Deploying the trained model in a production environment for real-time spam detection.
